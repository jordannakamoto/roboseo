Do I need to have liability insurance?
Yes, every resident is required to obtain a minimum of $100,000 in liability insurance. Verification of coverage will be necessary before Will can receive his keys. Our insurance partner, Assurant, will be sending out instructions closer to move-in on how to easily enroll or provide proof of coverage. Please be advised that liability insurance does NOT cover your personal belongings. You may obtain a renters' insurance policy if you desire.
What Should I Bring To My New Apartment?
While the furniture and appliances are included, below is a guide to help you with the personal belongings that you will need to provide: 
 
COMMON AREA: Electronics and corresponding cords/adapters, décor, trash can, trash bags, pots and pans, plates, cups, eating/serving utensils, coffee maker. Cleaning/disinfecting supplies, dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, etc.

Option 1: Enter a service request through the online resident portal. 
Option 2: E‐mail your request to your community and a team member will enter a service request on your behalf. 
Option 3: Visit or call the office during normal business hours and a team member will be happy to enter your service request. If it is after business hours, you are welcome to leave a message with an after-hours representative. 
 
For Emergency Requests: A maintenance team member is on call 24/7 for emergency maintenance needs (i.e. door/window lock issues, major leaks, plumbing, no heat or AC during weather extremes, refrigerator not cooling, no electricity/gas/water, etc.). 
How Does Roommate Matching Work?
Are you looking for more control over how you are matched with roommates? Through the RoomSync app, residents are empowered to choose roommates and build a sense of community using lifestyle habits such as cleanliness levels, studying habits, sleep cycles, and more. RoomSync offers an experience that supports a diverse and inclusive matching community through gender-inclusive tools. Furthermore, the app recognizes the importance of living criteria like service and emotional support animals and factors this into the matching process. ​
Resident Events to Keep You Involved
At Union Knoxville, you will create life-long relationships and connections! Our team plans resident events to get you involved. These events range from pizza parties to karaoke nights, from resume-building classes to gaming tournaments.  
How are utilities charged?
You will receive a bill each month from Conservice for your portion of the electricity, sewer, and water. This will be paid through your resident portal each month. There is no need to set up utilities on your own! 
What is ResidentLink?
Build your credit by paying your rent on time! ResidentLink is a service that enables you to build your credit by simply paying your rent on time. Pay your rent on time each month and ResidentLink will take care of the rest. An additional fee of $6.95 is required for this service and residents will receive information on how to sign up at move-in.  ​

Rent is due the first of each month and may be paid online by ACH, debit or credit card through the resident portal or by check or money order at the leasing office. Convenience fees may be charged for online payments.  ​
Can I pay my rent by credit card and when is it due?
Yes. Residents can pay online 24 hours per day, by credit card or ACH electronic checking. We also offer automatic payment by either credit card or checking account — just fill out one page, one time and payments will be made automatically. Convenience fees apply for credit card and debit card payments. We do not accept checks or cash.  
 
Rent is due the first of each month and may be paid online. Late fees vary by property. Refer to your lease for more information. ​
If I pay in full, do I get a discount?
​We do not offer a discount for paying in full at this time.
When do I put down a deposit?
​Your deposit must be paid prior to your lease being executed. 
Will you send me a bill each month for my rent?
​You will not recieve an invoice each month; your rent will post to your resident portal, along with your utility charges! 
When is my first payment due?
​Fall 2024 residents' first installment of rent is due by August 1st, 2024. 
What Are Rental Installments? Why Is My Rent Not Prorated?
The typical lease term is approximately 11.5 months of occupancy which coincides with the university’s academic calendar. The resident is charged a total rent amount for the contracted lease period. The lease agreement will reflect the total rent amount divided into 12 equal installments due August 1 - July 1.  These installments do not represent a monthly rent amount and are not prorated. ​
Will my financial aid cover my rent?
Your living costs can be covered by financial aid, just like on-campus housing. Any available financial aid funds, after university charges are satisfied, are released to the student for non-institutional expenses, such as off-campus housing. These funds can be used to pay rent. Normal payment deadlines will continue to apply. ​
What is included in the rental installment?
Your rental installment includes community-wide Wi-Fi, furniture, maintenance, amenities, and community events! ​
Can I pay my bill with a credit card? Is there an extra charge?
​You can make payments online with a credit card. There are transaction fees that apply with the use of a credit card and it is a percentage based off the amount of the transaction. You will be shown the convenience fee when making the payment and will be required to agree to the extra fee before the payment is processed.  
What utilities are included in my rent?
Your rent includes high-speed Wi-Fi, free printing, furniture, incredible maintenance, amenities, and community-wide events!
How do our rates compare to on-campus housing rates?
​When comparing our rates to on-campus rates you must take into consideration many variables, including floor plan layout, square footage, furniture, utilities, and community events. Our leasing staff is available to discuss with you how our rates compare to other housing options and validate that our community offers you the best value for your money, as well as a great location and incredible amenities.
What types of leases are available?
​At Union Knoxville, we provide individual leases! An individual lease means that you are only responsible for your rental installment and not the rent of your roommate. With an individual lease, you have the rights to joint use of the common spaces and then individual rights to your bedroom and bathroom. All of our individual leases are for 12-month periods.
Do I need a guarantor?
​Yes. All leases are required to have a guarantor. If an approved guarantor cannot be obtained, Union Knoxville will accept a security deposit equal to one month’s rent. 
What if I need to cancel my lease?
​You will be responsible for finding an individual to relet your lease from you! Contact our team for further details. 
How Long Is The Lease Agreement?
Leases at Union Knoxville begin in mid-August and terminate in late July. Payments are broken up into 12 equal installments.
What is a guarantor, and do I need one?
A guarantor is an individual who signs a lease agreement along with a renter promising to uphold the lease agreement in the event a renter defaults on their financial obligations. The guarantor can be a parent, spouse, extended family member, or friend but will need to be in good financial standing and pass all necessary screenings. 
When can I move in?
​On the date your lease begins! Union Knoxville does not anticipate being able to acommodate early move-ins. We will send out communication regarding move-in times  and processes closer to the lease start date.
Do I need to be a student to live here?
No! If you meet our qualifying criteria, you do not need to be a student! ​
How does roommate matching work?
Through the RoomSync app, residents are empowered to choose roommates and build a sense of community using lifestyle habits such as cleanliness levels, study habits, sleep cycles, and more. RoomSync offers an experience that supports a diverse and inclusive matching community through gender-inclusive tools. Furthermore, the app recognizes the importance of living criteria such as service and emotional support animals and factors this into the matching process.
​
Are apartments furnished?
​Yes, all our apartments are fully furnished! You are more than welcome to bring any additional furniture of your own, but please keep in mind that we will not store furniture for you. If you choose to remove any of the provided furniture, you will need to store it yourself and bring it back before the end of the lease term in its original condition. 
Is parking available?
​Union Knoxville provides covered garage parking! Parking spaces are limited, and there is a monthly cost associated with parking in our garage. Residents who secure parking for the lease term will be given an assigned spot and gate access to the garage. Any resident parked in a spot other than the one assigned to them will be subject to tow. 
What size are the beds?
​Our beds are size Full XL!
What On-Site Security Features Do You Offer?
At Union Knoxville, each resident is issued an electronic key fob used to access their front door and community amenities. For those with parking, we provide a RFID tag to our gated garage. We provide personal keys for bedroom doors; no other roommates will have the key to your bedroom. Smoke detectors and fire sprinklers are located throughout the property as well as inside each apartment. Video cameras will be throughout the parking garage, elevators, hallways, and amenity areas. Union Knoxville also features on-site management, maintenance staff, Community Assistants and after-hours security patrol officers. ​
How do I receive mail and packages?
Mail - Resident mail is delivered by the US Postal Service to your assigned mailbox. At move-in, you will receive a mailbox key. When you move-out, if you want to have your mail forwarded, you will need to complete a Change of Address Form with the local US Post Office. 
 
Packages - Packages will be delivered to the package room and can be retrieved 24/7 with your unique pickup code. 
 ​
What are the policies on pets, smoking and guests?
Union Knoxville is pet-friendly! Dogs and cats under 75 pounds are more than welcome at our community. Please check with the leasing office regarding restricted breeds and costs associated with bringing your furry friend!  
 
Our community is smoke-free in all indoor and adjacent areas.  
 
Guests are always welcome, subject to the consent of roommates and security considerations. Overnight guests are welcome, with limits on the number of days and guests (please review your lease for specific guest info). You are responsible for the conduct of your guests, invitees, family members, and any other person whom you allow to enter the property or apartment as if such conduct were your own. ​
