Updates:

Image field in Alt Tag Panel can now be double clicked to show the full url of the image.

Bugs:
Looks like we need to refresh the page in between clients...
If a client is loaded with non-matching frog data, the app's client data storage seems to corrupt.


Todo:
remove caption from state.
