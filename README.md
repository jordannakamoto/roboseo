# SEO Content Refresher
Designed for a client to speed up webscraping and data entry for SEO content writing. This is for a marketing agency, who is recommending optimizations for a large national real estae company with many individual property managers and web admins. Ongoing updates are being implemented on a different version on client's machine.

# Project Overview

Challenge:
Managing seasonal SEO updates across hundreds of websites and thousands of pages is time-consuming and requires manual processes behind several different tools.

Solution:
An integrated workspace that centralizes all SEO editing tasks:
- Page data collection via scraping.
- Metadata editing with visual page previews
- AI recommendations for content updates
- Bulk image review with editable alt tags
- Integration with Google Sheets for writing final work report for delivery

This tool reduces friction in high-volume SEO work, enabling faster turnaround and a better UX.
